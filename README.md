# RVMob

**RVMob** is a mobile Revolt client made in React Native. 

RVMob is currently in beta, exclusive to Android and pretty unoptimized - use at your own discretion.

## Building

<!-- ~~If you want to install, simply go to [the releases tab](https://github.com/revoltchat/rvmob/releases) and download the latest version. Please note that releases generated by GitHub Actions are automated, largely untested, and may include bugs.~~ -->

Right now, if you want to install RVMob you will have to build it yourself. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) and [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx). Then run the following:

```sh
yarn install
npx rn-nodeify -e
yarn start
```

CLI commands:

| Command          | Description                            |
| -----------------| -------------------------------------- |
| `yarn start`     | Starts the application.                |
| `yarn test`      | Tests to see if everything is working. |
| `yarn android`   | Runs an Android version.               |
| `yarn ios`       | Runs an iOS version (requires a Mac).  |

For more see a list of `react-native`'s commands [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/commands.md). You can access them by running `npx react-native`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter bugs, first check if you're able to [open Revolt in your browser](https://app.revolt.chat). Also check if you have any firewall settings that may block the Revolt API.

If you're still experiencing issues, and there aren't any open issues for the bug(s) you're facing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/revoltchat/rvmob/issues).
