# RVMob

**RVMob** is a mobile Revolt client made in React Native. 

**Please note that RVMob is currently in beta.** It is exclusive to Android, contains several bugs/incomplete features and is pretty unoptimized - use at your own discretion.

For development updates and other news, join [RVMob's support server](https://rvlt.gg/YW312HPF).

## Building

<!-- ~~If you want to install RVMob, simply go to [the releases tab](https://github.com/revoltchat/rvmob/releases) and download the latest version. Please note that releases generated by GitHub Actions are automated, largely untested, and may include bugs.~~ -->

Right now, if you want to install RVMob you will have to build it yourself. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) and [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx). Then run the following:

```sh
yarn install
npx rn-nodeify -e
npx react-native-asset
yarn android # for the android app
```

CLI commands:

| Command          | Description                                 |
| -----------------| --------------------------------------      |
| `yarn start`     | Starts Metro (the dev server).              |

For more information, see a list of `react-native`'s commands [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/commands.md). You can access them by running `yarn react-native`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter bugs, first check if you're able to [open Revolt in your browser](https://app.revolt.chat); also, check if you have any firewall settings that may block the Revolt API.

If you're still experiencing issues, and there aren't any open issues for the bug(s) you're facing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/revoltchat/rvmob/issues).
